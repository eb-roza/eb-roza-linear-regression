# Marginal Distributions
# a. Obtain estimates of the following quantities for Volume (ft3). (3 pts)

#Joint Distributions of (Circumference,Volume) and (Over,Volume)


# C.  Create a plot visualizing the joint distribution of 
# ...Volume (Y) vs. Circumference (X).  Give a brief statement 
# (one or two sentences) about the general patterns you see in 
# this plot. Would you characterize the joint distribution as 
# BVN? Why or why not? (4 pts.)

hay %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=circum, y=volume)) +
  geom_point()

# Both variables do not have a bell-shaped curve or appear to be
# approximately normally distributed, though they do appear to have
# a linear pattern.  Would not consider this distribution to be 
# bivariate normal.


# d. Create a plot visualizing the joint distribution of 
# Volume (Y) vs. Over (X).  Give a brief statement (one or two 
# sentences) about the general patterns you see in this plot. Would
# you characterize the joint distribution as BVN? Why or why not? (4 pts.)

hay %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=over, y=volume)) +
  geom_point()

# Both variables do  have a bell-shaped curve and appear to be
# approximately normally distributed, though they do appear to have
# a linear pattern.  Would consider this distribution to be 
# bivariate normal.


# e. Which potential predictor, circumference or over, appears to 
# have the strongest relationship with the volume of the haystack? 
# Explain.  (2 pts.) 

# Over; there is less variation both visually and in the summary
# statistics as well as a very strong linear pattern obeserved.


# f. Show the math as to why it is reasonable to estimate the 
# volume of a haystack using the the relationship below. (3 pts)

# hay stacks are half-spheres, so the volume of a sphere is 
# 4*pi*r, and the volume of a hemi-sphere is 2/3*pi*r^3; 
# this would just be showing the equality using these two 
# relationships assuming they are hemispherical.


# g. Use the function above as an estimate of the mean function for 
# Volume | Circumference.  You can use the JMP Calculator to create
# a new column containing the mean function values.  Plot this 
# estimated mean function on a scatterplot of Volume vs. 
# Circumference.  This is can done by first forming a new column 
# containing the formula above and then using Graph > Overlay Plots 
# in JMP to plot both Volume and Volume Formula vs. Circumference.   (3 pts)
