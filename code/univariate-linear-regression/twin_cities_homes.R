# a.How would you characterize the marginal distributions of List 
# Price (Y) and SQFT (X), the finished living area (ft2)? (2 pts.)

# List price has a large amount of variation, but is approximately
# log-normal.  Square footage has less variation, and is also
# approximately log-normal.

# b. Use Tukeyâ€™s Ladder of Powers to find power transformations of 
# ListPrice and SQFT to improve approximate normality.  
# Include plots of your transformed variables.  (4 pts.)

# d. Use the Bulging Rule to find a transformation of List Price 
# ( call it ) and SQFT (call it ) such that  and .  You may not be 
# able to achieve both of these goals, but try.  Include a 
#scatterplot of .  You can do this in JMP or using trendscatter in 
# R.  (5 pts.)
