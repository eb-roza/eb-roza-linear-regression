# Marginal Distributions
# a. Obtain estimates of the following quantities for Volume (ft3). (3 pts)

#Joint Distributions of (Circumference,Volume) and (Over,Volume)

# C.  Create a plot visualizing the joint distribution of 
# ...Volume (Y) vs. Circumference (X).  Give a brief statement 
# (one or two sentences) about the general patterns you see in 
# this plot. Would you characterize the joint distribution as 
# BVN? Why or why not? (4 pts.)

hay %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=circum, y=volume)) +
  geom_point()

# volume and circumfrence have a linear pattern, with volume
# increasing as circumference increases.  There appear to be some
# exsting leverage points to be explored.



# d. Create a plot visualizing the joint distribution of 
# Volume (Y) vs. Over (X).  Give a brief statement (one or two 
# sentences) about the general patterns you see in this plot. Would
# you characterize the joint distribution as BVN? Why or why not? (4 pts.)

hay %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=over, y=volume)) +
  geom_point()

# volume and circumfrence have an exteremely strong linear pattern, with 
# volume increasing as over increases.

# e. Which potential predictor, circumference or over, appears to 
# have the strongest relationship with the volume of the haystack? 
# Explain.  (2 pts.) 

# Over; there is less variation both visually and in the summary
# statistics as well as a very strong linear pattern obeserved.

# g. Use the function above as an estimate of the mean function for 
# Volume | Circumference.  You can use the JMP Calculator to create
# a new column containing the mean function values.  Plot this 
# estimated mean function on a scatterplot of Volume vs. 
# Circumference.  This is can done by first forming a new column 
# containing the formula above and then using Graph > Overlay Plots 
# in JMP to plot both Volume and Volume Formula vs. Circumference.   (3 pts)
